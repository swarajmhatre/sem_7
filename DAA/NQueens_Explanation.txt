This C++ code solves the N-Queens problem using a backtracking algorithm. Here are the key points of the code:

1. The code includes necessary C++ libraries.

2. It defines a function `isSafe` that checks if it's safe to place a queen at a given position `(x, y)` on the chessboard.

3. The `printBoard` function displays the chessboard with queens represented as "[Q]" and empty cells as "[]".

4. The `nQueen` function uses recursive backtracking to find all possible solutions to the N-Queens problem. It places queens on the board and ensures they don't attack each other, then recursively explores all possibilities.

5. In the `main` function, the user inputs the value of `n`, which represents the size of the chessboard and the number of queens to be placed.

6. It dynamically allocates memory for a 2D array `arr` to represent the chessboard.

7. It calls the `nQueen` function to find and print all possible solutions to the N-Queens problem.

8. After finding and printing all solutions, it displays the message "--------All possible solutions--------."

9. The code analyzes its time complexity as O(N!) and auxiliary space complexity as O(N^2).

The time and space complexity of the N-Queens problem-solving algorithm in the provided code can be analyzed as follows:

1. Time Complexity:
   - The primary time complexity of the algorithm is driven by the backtracking process to find all possible solutions.
   - In the worst case, the algorithm explores all possible combinations to place N queens on the N×N chessboard.
   - This results in a time complexity of O(N!), as there are N possibilities for the first queen, (N-1) for the second, (N-2) for the third, and so on.
   - In practice, the algorithm may terminate early if it finds a solution and backtracks in the process, making the actual running time faster for many cases.

2. Space Complexity:
   - The primary space complexity is determined by the memory used for the chessboard representation.
   - The code dynamically allocates memory for a 2D array `arr` of size N×N to represent the chessboard.
   - This results in a space complexity of O(N^2) because you're using an N×N array to represent the chessboard.
   - Additional space complexity comes from the recursive call stack during the backtracking process, but it's generally much smaller than the chessboard representation.

In summary, the time complexity of this code is O(N!) in the worst case, and the space complexity is O(N^2) due to the 2D array used to represent the chessboard. The actual performance may vary depending on the specific input and how early the algorithm terminates when a solution is found.
